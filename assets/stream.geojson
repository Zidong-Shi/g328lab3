The Dungeness River flows in a northerly direction from the rugged mountain peaks of Olympic National Park to the Strait of Juan De Fuca at Dungeness Bay.  The upper portion of the river flows through steep narrow canyons while the lower ten miles is characterized by gently sloping plains. \r\n\r\nThe Dungeness River at Schoolhouse Rd. stream gage is located about four miles north of Sequim Washington at the Anderson Rd./ Schoolhouse Bridge crossing (approximate River Mile 0.75) near the community of Dungeness \r\n\r\nOver the last 25 years the population of the Dungeness valley including the city of Sequim, has increased dramatically, altering the river environment.  One of the environmental concerns associated with the watershed has been the increase in Fecal Coliform bacteria in Dungeness Bay.  These increasing bacteria levels have led to recent shellfish harvest closures.\r\n\r\nIn November of 1999 the Washington Department of Ecology, in cooperation with the Jamestown S'Kllallam Tribe and Clallam County began conducting a water quality study to identify bacterial sources that contribute to the poor water quality in the bay. Water quality scientists chose to monitor streams that enter Dungeness Bay in the vicinity of the closure area, including the Dungeness River.  \r\n\r\nThe Department of Ecology's Stream Hydrology Unit (SHU) was requested to provide the flow information for this project and installed continuous stage-height and temperature recording equipment near the mouth of the Dungeness River.  A series of stream discharge measurements, expressed in cubic feet per second (cfs), have been made throughout the course of the project. A rating curve was determined by plotting these measured discharges against their corresponding stages at the times they were measured. The rating curves and their associated regression equations are then used to predict flows (discharge) at a given stage.\r\n\r\nThis water quality project was concluded in November of 2000.  However, the Dungeness River Management Team has requested SHU continue monitoring flow on the river in order to better manage issues facing the Dungeness watershed.\r\n\r\nIn the Spring of 2002, in cooperation with the USGS, the Department of Ecology upgraded the station to transmit data every three hours back to Ecology headquarters.","StationComments":null,"LatitudeDecimal":48.14340512,"LongitudeDecimal":-123.12873088,"StationParamsDescription":"Air Temp.,Discharge,Stage,Water Temp.","FlowStationUrlDescription":"https://apps.ecology.wa.gov/ContinuousFlowAndWQ/StationDetails?sta=18A050","GlobalID":"626b1597-d89f-4c41-875c-e1d4ecf83646","created_user":"WAECY_Geoservices","created_date":"Wed, 05 Feb 2025 18:10:10 GMT","last_edited_user":"WAECY_Geoservices","last_edited_date":"Wed, 05 Feb 2025 18:10:10 GMT"}},{"type":"Feature","id":74,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.352054000292,48.1106470002281]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":74,"StationID":191,"StationCode":"18C070","StationName":"Morse Cr. @ Four Seasons Ranch","CoopFlag":0,"StatusDescription":"Removed","StationTypeDescription":"Dial-Up","StationSubTypesDescription":"Flow Monitoring Station","RiverMileValue":0.5,"StationDescription":"Morse Creek is an independent drainage located between the Dungeness and Elwha rivers on the North Slope of the Olympic Peninsula in Washington State. The main stem of Morse Creek is 16.3 miles long with a total drainage area of approximately 57 square miles. The head waters of the creek range from 4,000 to 5,000 feet elevation in the Hurricane Ridge area of Olympic National Park and flows in a northerly direction to its mouth at the Strait of Juan De Fuca about five miles east of Port Angeles in Clallam County. The two largest tributaries are Maiden Creek (confluence at river mile 10.5) and Lake Creek (confluence at river mile 7.5). The City of Port Angeles diversion dam is located at river mile7. \r\n\r\nMorse Creek is relatively high-gradient, steep and fast flowing throughout its length. Even the lower reaches are characterized by long, steep riffles. The average gradient for its entire length is greater than 6 percent. \r\n\r\nMorse Creek has been known for its valuable salmon runs and is currently considered a high priority candidate for salmon habitat restoration.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn August of 2000 the Department of Ecology's Stream Hydrology Unit installed a flow monitoring station near the mouth of Morse Creek at the request of the Elwha/Morse Watershed Management Team.  The management team is comprised of a diverse coalition of stakeholder caucuses including Clallam County, the City of Port Angeles, the (Lower) Elwha Kllallam Tribe, Department of Ecology as well as private landowners, business/commercial interests, fisheries and recreation interests and environmentalists among others. The group was founded in response to the Watershed Planning Act, WA RCW Title 90, Chapter 90.82.  Presently they are early in the planning process, gathering, analyzing and organizing data.  One of the tasks assigned to the planning team is to develop a water budget and water balance analysis.  As a result, Ecology's Stream Hydrology Unit was asked to supply flow information to assist in this effort.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ecology flow monitoring station is equipped with a data logger and a pressure transducer for recording and measuring stage-height at fifteen-minute intervals.  After taking several discharge measurements, a rating curve is determined by plotting these measured discharges against the stage heights at the time of the measurements. The rating curve and its associated regression equation, applied to the recorded stage-height measurements, produce a record of predicted flows.","StationComments":"Due to budget cuts, this station is slated for removal effective October 1, 2010","LatitudeDecimal":48.110647,"LongitudeDecimal":-123.352054,"StationParamsDescription":"Discharge,Stage,Water Temp.","FlowStationUrlDescription":"https://apps.ecology.wa.gov/ContinuousFlowAndWQ/StationDetails?sta=18C070","GlobalID":"3e9b0e39-4af7-4e6c-9152-88bbe0bce458","created_user":"WAECY_Geoservices","created_date":"Wed, 05 Feb 2025 18:10:10 GMT","last_edited_user":"WAECY_Geoservices","last_edited_date":"Wed, 05 Feb 2025 18:10:10 GMT"}},{"type":"Feature","id":75,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.350330000144,48.0376069999075]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":75,"StationID":192,"StationCode":"18C150","StationName":"Morse Cr. blw Aqueduct","CoopFlag":0,"StatusDescription":"Active","StationTypeDescription":"Telemetered","StationSubTypesDescription":"Flow Monitoring Station","RiverMileValue":6.5,"StationDescription":"The Elwha-Morse Management Team (EMMT) suggested this station based upon Morse Creek’s importance to salmon recovery efforts in Clallam County.

The stream channel is well defined, and bank vegetation is generally favorable for salmon except in the heaviest areas of residential development. During the irrigation season, McDonald Creek is used by the irrigation districts to transport Dungeness River water for irrigation purposes. Up to 5 cfs of Dungeness River water is diverted into McDonald Creek at river mile 4.1. The water is then removed again at river mile 3.2.

Draining approximately 35 square miles of commercial forest lands, the headwaters of Bingham Creek emanate from the forested slopes of South Mountain, the southernmost peak of the Olympic mountains.    \r\n\r\nCoho salmon and steelhead spawn and rear in Bingham Creek.  The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) spawn, rear, and release both coho and steelhead from their hatchery facility located at the confluence of Bingham Creek and the East Fork Satsop River.  WDFW also operates a research facility located upstream of the hatchery which monitors adult and juvenile salmon population trends. \r\n\r\nThe Ecology flow monitoring station, established in September 2000, is equipped with a Design Analysis Model 500 data logger and a Design Analysis Model H-310 pressure transducer for recording and measuring stage-height at fifteen minute intervals.  The station is also equipped with a staff gage.  Recently, a Design Analysis Model H-219 telephone modem has been installed.  The modem allows SHU to download the data at regular intervals, typically daily, and post “real-time” data to our webpage. \r\n\r\nAs of March 2002, a total of 9 discrete flow measurements have been conducted at the station.  Using the continuous instrument records of water pressure, the stage height(s), and the discrete flows, an accurate relationship between these variables has been established.  This relationship, or rating curve, has been used to create a predicted record of stream discharge at fifteen minute intervals since the station was installed.  In addition, a water temperature probe incorporated into the H-310 pressure transducer has enabled us to create a continuous thermograph for the site.","StationComments":"This station was permanently decommissioned in October 2008.","LatitudeDecimal":47.144375,"LongitudeDecimal":-123.402166,"StationParamsDescription":"Discharge,Stage,Water Temp.","FlowStationUrlDescription":"https://apps.ecology.wa.gov/ContinuousFlowAndWQ/StationDetails?sta=22K070","GlobalID":"8b07b9d3-57ca-480d-8274-caa3fd180e46","created_user":"WAECY_Geoservices","created_date":"Wed, 05 Feb 2025 18:10:10 GMT","last_edited_user":"WAECY_Geoservices","last_edited_date":"Wed, 05 Feb 2025 18:10:10 GMT"}},{"type":"Feature","id":102,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.943495000391,46.8659019997521]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":102,"StationID":220,"StationCode":"22L070","StationName":"Johns R. @ Western","CoopFlag":0,"StatusDescription":"Removed","StationTypeDescription":"Staff Gage","StationSubTypesDescription":"Flow Monitoring Station","RiverMileValue":5.5,"StationDescription":null,"StationComments":"Due to budget cuts, monitoring at this station has been discontinued effective October 1, 2009.","LatitudeDecimal":46.865902,"LongitudeDecimal":-123.943495,"StationParamsDescription":"Discharge,Stage","FlowStationUrlDescription":"https://apps.ecology.wa.gov/ContinuousFlowAndWQ/StationDetails?sta=22L070","GlobalID":"95dd498c-890b-468f-83dd-6c6e34106682","created_user":"WAECY_Geoservices","created_date":"Wed, 05 Feb 2025 18:10:10 GMT","last_edited_user":"WAECY_Geoservices","last_edited_date":"Wed, 05 Feb 2025 18:10:10 GMT"}},{"type":"Feature","id":103,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.817653835847,46.9012921969085]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":103,"StationID":221,"StationCode":"22M070","StationName":"Newskah Cr. blw Falls Creek","CoopFlag":0,"StatusDescription":"Removed","StationTypeDescription":"Staff Gage","StationSubTypesDescription":"Flow Monitoring Station","RiverMileValue":4,"StationDescription":null,"StationComments":"Due to budget cuts, monitoring at this station has been discontinued effective October 1, 2009.","LatitudeDecimal":46.9012922,"LongitudeDecimal":-123.81765384,"StationParamsDescription":"Discharge,Stage","FlowStationUrlDescription":"https://apps.ecology.wa.gov/ContinuousFlowAndWQ/StationDetails?sta=22M070","GlobalID":"d606717b-826c-4146-9742-cd409bf9b843","created_user":"WAECY_Geoservices","created_date":"Wed, 05 Feb 2025 18:10:10 GMT","last_edited_user":"WAECY_Geoservices","last_edited_date":"Wed, 05 Feb 2025 18:10:10 GMT"}},{"type":"Feature","id":104,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.816025999348,47.0849759995983]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":104,"StationID":222,"StationCode":"22P080","StationName":"E.F.

Huckleberry and Long ridges divide the headwaters of the Grays River from the upper Chehalis, Willapa, and Naselle river watersheds. The Grays River streamflow gage is located 10.5 miles upstream of the confluence with the Columbia River. The watershed area above the gage is roughly 94 square miles. The mouth of the Grays River opens into Grays Bay adjacent to the mouth of the Deep River.\r\nThere is an additional 30 square miles of tributary stream watersheds that drain into the Grays River downstream of this streamflow gage. This lower watershed is 24% of the total Grays River watershed area.

The geology of the upper basin is predominantly basalt and glacial outwash. It is less vulnerable to mass wasting and erosion than the adjacent Snow Creek headwaters because basalt and breccia underlies this upper canyon reach. The lower valley is characterized by sand, gravel, and clay deposited during glaciation. Material transported from the upper watershed forms a broad alluvial fan. Originally, Salmon Creek was joined by Snow Creek at RM 0.6, but Snow Creek now flows separately to the estuary through an artificial channel. Salmon Creek consists of 8.7 miles of mainstem channel and 21.8 miles of tributary streams.","StationComments":null,"LatitudeDecimal":47.985001,"LongitudeDecimal":-122.890001,"StationParamsDescription":"Air Temp.,Battery,Discharge,Stage,Water Temp.","FlowStationUrlDescription":"https://apps.ecology.wa.gov/ContinuousFlowAndWQ/StationDetails?sta=17F050","GlobalID":"9a05e2ea-0f84-49f0-9413-0e605ef7e0d7","created_user":"WAECY_Geoservices","created_date":"Wed, 05 Feb 2025 18:10:10 GMT","last_edited_user":"WAECY_Geoservices","last_edited_date":"Wed, 05 Feb 2025 18:10:10 GMT"}},{"type":"Feature","id":296,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-120.403080000513,47.7436800003322]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":296,"StationID":423,"StationCode":"46D070","StationName":"Tillicum Cr. blw Indian Cr.","CoopFlag":0,"StatusDescription":"Removed","StationTypeDescription":"Telemetered","StationSubTypesDescription":"Flow Monitoring Station","RiverMileValue":0.6,"StationDescription":null,"StationComments":"Due to budget cuts, this station has been removed effective October 1, 2013.

This structure is operated by the Lexington Flood Control District and helps protect local homes and businesses from high flows in the river and creek.
